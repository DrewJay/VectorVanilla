# VectorVanilla üç¶
Experimental implementation of neural network library in TypeScript.

## What does it do?
Not much more (probably less) than any other neural network library. Goal of this project is to create and test experimental stochastic algorithms used for backpropagation and error calculation. This project offers platform for quick prototyping and testing implemented methods.

## Usage Example
You can find it in the `src/main.ts` file, the example approximates sine function and plots the result.
